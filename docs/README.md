[D][] Finish CS2103 work (by: Feb 19 2025 1800)

### Preventing duplicates
When adding a new task, the system will check if a task with the same description exists in the task list. If it exists, it will notify you with a duplicate message.

#### Example 
Suppose your task list contains the following  
`[D][] Finish CS2103 work (by: Feb 19 2025 1800)`

If the following command is submitted  
`todo Finish CS2103`  

The system will detect that a task with the same description exist and will return the following output  
`This is a duplicate!!!`
