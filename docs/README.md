## Adding deadlines

To add a deadline, use the following command
`deadline <description> /by <DD/MM/YYYY HHMM>`

Example: 
`deadline Finish CS2103 work /by 19/02/2025 1800`
This will add a deadline task with the description "Finish CS2103 work", due on 19 February 2025 at 1800

Expected output:
```
Gotcha! I've added this task:
[D][] Finish CS2103 work (by: Feb 19 2025 1800)
Now you have 1 tasks in the list.
```
